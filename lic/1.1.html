This license grants rights only concerning projects created and managed by "A-Generation." Projects not associated with "A-Generation" are not permitted to reference this license. Any breach of this condition will result in the immediate revocation of all rights granted by this license.</p>

            <h2>2. Definition of Software and Its Use</h2>

Modifications should not violate the principle of good-faith usage.</p>

A-Generation acts as a free publisher, providing the source code openly without any guarantees regarding its functionality or fitness for any specific purpose. The license also absolves A-Generation from responsibility for the contents of the repository, including any changes made to the source code. The developer reserves the right to modify the code, remove portions of it, and release or withdraw versions at its discretion. The user acknowledges that the repository may be deleted at any time without prior notice.</p>

            <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>The Software is provided "as is," without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

            <h2>6. No Obligation for Maintenance or Support</h2>
            <p>A-Generation is under no obligation to provide maintenance, support, updates, enhancements, or modifications for the Software. Users are responsible for managing their own versions and ensuring that any modifications or usage comply with their systems' requirements.</p>
